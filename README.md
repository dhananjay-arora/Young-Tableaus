# Young-Tableaus
An m×n Young tableau is an m × n matrix such that the entries of each row are in sorted order from left to right and the entries of each column are in sorted order from top to bottom. Some of the entries of a Young tableau may be ∞, which we treat as nonexistent elements. Thus, a Young tableau can be used to hold r ≤ mn finite numbers.  In order to maintain the Young tableau property we can consider any Young tableau as a modified heap, in which each element has two parent nodes (left and top), and two children nodes (right and down), so each element is then bigger or equals its parents nodes values and less or equals its children nodes values.
